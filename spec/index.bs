# Introduction

This specification defines the LLM Markup (LLMPM) layer, a declarative contract embedded in HTML to govern the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) infused User Agents.

# Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

## Conforming User Agents

A conforming **LLM-Infused User Agent** is a user agent that implements the algorithms defined in this specification.

Crucially, conformance requirements are placed on the **User Agent**, not the underlying Language Model.
*   **Policy Enforcement (Deterministic):** The User Agent MUST mechanistically enforce constraints defined in the `llm-policy` namespace. For example, if an element is marked `immutable`, the User Agent MUST prevent any LLM-driven modification to that element's content.
*   **Intent Conveyance (Deterministic Parsing):** The User Agent MUST deterministically parse attributes in the `llm-intent` namespace and construct a predictable context object or prompt segment for the attached Language Model. For example, if `<div llm-intent="summarize">` is encountered, the User Agent MUST generate a standardized signal (e.g., a specific JSON structure or system prompt token) every time. The User Agent is considered conformant if this *constructed context* matches the standard's definition; the subsequent probabilistic output generated by the LLM is outside the scope of this conformance requirement.
