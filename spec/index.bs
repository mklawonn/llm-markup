# Introduction

This specification defines the LLM Markup (LLMPM) layer, a declarative contract embedded in HTML to govern the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) infused User Agents.

# Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

## Conforming User Agents

A conforming **LLM-Infused User Agent** is a user agent that implements the algorithms defined in this specification.

Crucially, conformance requirements are placed on the **User Agent**, not the underlying Language Model.
*   **Policy Enforcement (Deterministic):** The User Agent MUST mechanistically enforce constraints defined in the `llm-policy` namespace. For example, if an element is marked `immutable`, the User Agent MUST prevent any LLM-driven modification to that element's content.
*   **Intent Conveyance (Probabilistic):** The User Agent MUST parse attributes in the `llm-intent` namespace and make them available as context to the attached Language Model. The User Agent is considered conformant if it successfully transmits these signals; the specific output generated by the probabilistic model is outside the scope of this conformance requirement.
