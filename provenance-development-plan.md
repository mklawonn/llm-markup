# Provenance Namespace Development Plan

The goal of the `llm-provenance` namespace is to enable **Trust, Accountability, and Auditability** for content consumed or generated by LLMs. Unlike `llm-policy` (Constraints) or `llm-intent` (Semantics), `llm-provenance` provides the **Evidence Layer** that answers: Who created this? When? How? Is it authentic?

This plan outlines the development of the alpha version of the Provenance Namespace.

## Phase 1: Identity & Attribution (The "Who")
*Focus: Identifying the creator and origin of the content.*

1.  **Standardize `llm-provenance-attribution` (Content Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Human-readable credit string. (Already exists in spec).
    *   **Value:** String (e.g., "Jane Doe, 2024").

2.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-author` (Semantic Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Structured identity data for machine processing.
    *   **Value:** URI (e.g., ORCID, Profile URL) or JSON-LD object reference.
    *   **Use Case:** Linking content to a verified author profile.

3.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-origin` (Topology Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** The canonical source URL of the content.
    *   **Value:** URI.
    *   **Use Case:** Tracking where a snippet came from (e.g., for citation in generated text).

## Phase 2: Integrity & Verification (The "Proof")
*Focus: Ensuring the content has not been tampered with.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-signature` (Data Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Cryptographic proof of authorship and integrity.
    *   **Value:** Compact signature string (e.g., JWS, Ed25519).
    *   **Mechanism:** Verifiable against a public key (potentially linked via `llm-provenance-key`).

2.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-hash` (Data Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Simple integrity check for non-signed content.
    *   **Value:** Hash string (e.g., `sha256:...`).
    *   **Use Case:** Verifying that a cached resource hasn't changed.

## Phase 3: Process & History (The "How" & "When")
*Focus: Understanding the generation method and timeline.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-timestamp` (Temporal Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Creation or modification time.
    *   **Value:** ISO 8601 Date String.
    *   **Use Case:** Filtering outdated information.

2.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-method` (Interaction Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Declare how the content was created.
    *   **Values:** `human`, `ai-generated`, `hybrid`, `unknown`.
    *   **Use Case:** Transparency labels ("This text was generated by AI").

3.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-model` (Interaction Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Specify the model used (if AI-generated).
    *   **Value:** String (e.g., `gpt-4`, `llama-2-70b`).
    *   **Use Case:** Debugging or auditing model behavior.

## Phase 4: Audit & Compliance (The "Record")
*Focus: Linking to external audit trails.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-history` (Audit Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Link to a full revision history or audit log.
    *   **Value:** URI.
    *   **Use Case:** "View Edit History" for wiki-style content.
