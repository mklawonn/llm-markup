# Provenance Namespace Development Plan

The goal of the `llm-provenance` namespace is to enable **Trust, Accountability, and Auditability** for content consumed or generated by LLMs.

Unlike `llm-policy` (Publisher Constraints) or `llm-intent` (Semantic Meaning), `llm-provenance` functions as an **Internal Ledger** or **Interchange Format** for the User Agent. It tracks the origin and reliability of information as it is synthesized from multiple sources (e.g., current page, external search, internal knowledge) into a final response.

This plan outlines the development of the alpha version of the Provenance Namespace, focusing on the **Agent-Centric / Synthesis Model**.

## Phase 1: Source Tracking (The "Where")
*Focus: Identifying the origin of information chunks.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-source` (Origin Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Track the canonical source URI of a content block.
    *   **Value:** URI (e.g., `https://techradar.com`, `urn:internal:knowledge-base`).
    *   **Use Case:** Enabling citations and source-linking in the final UI.

2.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-citation` (Presentation Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Provide a human-readable label for the source.
    *   **Value:** String (e.g., "[1]", "TechRadar", "User Knowledge").
    *   **Use Case:** Rendering citation badges next to generated text.

## Phase 2: Synthesis Roles (The "How")
*Focus: Defining how information is used in the synthesis.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-role` (Semantic Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Define the function of a content block within the synthesized response.
    *   **Proposed Taxonomy:**
        *   `primary`: The main subject matter (e.g., the current page content).
        *   `secondary`: Supporting evidence from external sources.
        *   `context`: Background information or definitions.
        *   `correction`: Agent-generated corrections or warnings (e.g., fact-checks).
    *   **Use Case:** UI highlighting (e.g., blue for primary, green for secondary, yellow for corrections).

## Phase 3: Reliability & Confidence (The "Trust")
*Focus: Communicating uncertainty.*

1.  **Introduce `llm-provenance-confidence` (Data Layer):**
    *   **Goal:** Express the agent's certainty in the accuracy of a specific chunk.
    *   **Value:** Float (0.0 - 1.0).
    *   **Use Case:** Graying out or flagging low-confidence information.
